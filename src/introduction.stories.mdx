# Volt Design System

Looking for ready to use styles to apply to your site or product? This design system is a collection of different web elements for a common Volt style.

We create one (or more) CSS files you can drop in your project. Take a look at the examples of different elements and web components to apply the styles.
For some (just a few interactive) components you also need to add JS files we provide.

## Example

Basic Button:

<Canvas name="Button default">
  <div class="volt default">
    <button>
      <span>I'm a button</span>
    </button>
  </div>
</Canvas>

<Canvas name="Button purple">
  <div class="volt purple">
    <button>
      <span>I'm the same button in purple mode</span>
    </button>
  </div>
</Canvas>

### Enabling the styles

You have to wrap your elements. The wrapping element has to have a `.volt` class. You can decide if you want the default (white) or purple design by adding `.purple` to the wrapping element.

### More Information

On the left you'll find a sidebar. There's a section for elements. Open it to find all available elements.

## Principles

We use some common rules and philosphies for developing the design system. Make sure to look at the Foundation section to understand how it works.
